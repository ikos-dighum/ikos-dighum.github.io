# About

The Digital Area Studies (DAS) research group is based at the [Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages (IKOS)](https://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/research/) at the Faculty of Humanities, University of Oslo. Our aim is to encourage scholars in the humanities to use digital tools in research through themed seminars, hands-on, problem-solving workshops, and sharing through our website. 

We concentrate on learning and applying R to analyze data, create visualizations, and working with text. We also aim to create a hub for resources on how to work programmatically with text in non-Latin languages such as Arabic, Persian, Japanese, and Mandarin.

The DAS group meets every second Monday throughout the semester -- see the calendar for details. Besides serving as the home of repositories made by group members, this website functions as a communication hub between meetings.

Feel free to contact Jacob HÃ¸igilt (jacobhoi@uio.no) or Erik Skare (eriskar@uio.no) with any questions or suggestions.
