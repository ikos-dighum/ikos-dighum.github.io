# Tasks

- Read and work through the code in ch 7 in [Introduction to R](https://intro2r.com/prog_r.html). It takes less time than you think, and you need the whole chapter to make sense of the loops sections towards the end. By the way, this is a brand new book which is very friendly, and I recommend you read the whole book, replicating the code in it as you go along.
- Did you get more than one .json file when you processed your PDF document(s) with daiR for our previous session? If so, try to write a loop that works through the .json files you got and creates one .txt file out of them, containing all the text from the pdf document you OCR-ed with daiR. Take a look at [Jacob's code](/jacobs_code.R) which includes such a loop (kindly written by Thomas).
