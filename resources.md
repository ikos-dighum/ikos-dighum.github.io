# Resources

## R resources

* Downloading R and R Studio: [Homepage of the R-project](https://cran.r-project.org/).

* How to use daiR: [Erik's example](/contents/using_dair.html).

* How to create a timeline with gg_vistime: Jacob's example(/contents/tidslinje.html). Can be used with this [.csv file](/contents/tidslinje.csv). Tutorial for the [gg_vistime package](https://shosaco.github.io/vistime/articles/gg_vistime-vignette.html).

## Python resources

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

We usually need to preprocess our text before analysis (removing [stopwords](https://kavita-ganesan.com/what-are-stop-words/#.Y9kqAq3MJaQ), [lemmatization](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/lemmatization), and [tokenization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-how-tokenizing-text-sentence-words-works/)). This is what we call Natural Language Processing (NLP). Although R is one of our favourite tools for text mining and analysis, Python has several packages that are superior when doing NLP:

* Natural Language Processing with SpaCy: [Erik's example](/contents/spacy_language_processing.html).

## Markdown resources:

* Markdown with Zotero and Better Bibtex: [Jacob's example](/contents/betterbibtex/markdown_zotero.html). 
* Writing markdown in Quarto: [Jacob's markdown script](/contents/miniguide_quarto.qmd).
* Modifying VS Codium through its settings.json file: [Erik's example](/contents/optimizing_vs_codium.html).

## A quick guide for High Performance Computing (HPC) and Slurm

High Performance Computing (HPC) is becoming increasingly important as we process, analyze, and perform complex calculations of increasing amounts of data. HPC uses clusters of powerful processors that work in parallel at extremely high speeds. The University of Oslo has its own HPC cluster called [Fox](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/fox/index.html).

* How run Python and R scripts in Fox: [Erik's quick guide](/contents/quick_guide_to_hpc_and_slurm.html).
