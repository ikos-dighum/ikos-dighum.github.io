## Changing settings in VS Codium

One of the great things about VS Codium is that you can adjust it according to your needs (whether that pertains to hard wrap, colorization, extensions, and so on). One way of modifying VS Codium is changing the settings.json file. See [Erik's example](/contents/optimizing_vs_codium.html)

## Preprocessing text with SpaCy

We usually need to preprocess our text before analysis (removing [stopwords](https://kavita-ganesan.com/what-are-stop-words/#.Y9kqAq3MJaQ), [lemmatization](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/lemmatization), and [tokenization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-how-tokenizing-text-sentence-words-works/). This is what we call Natural Language Processing (NLP). Although R is one of our favourite tools for text mining and analysis, Python has several packages that are superior when doing NLP. Here is Erik's [python code for preprocessing Norwegian text](/contents/norwegian_preprocessing.ipynb) with lemmatization and stopword removal. You can with ease download and change the language module to preprocess Chinese, Japanese, English, or Russian texts (to mention just a few).
