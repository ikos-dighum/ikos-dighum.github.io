# Resources

## R resources

* Downloading R and R Studio: [Homepage of the R-project](https://cran.r-project.org/).
* How to use daiR: [Erik Skare's example](/contents/htmls/using_dair.html).
* How to create a timeline with gg_vistime: [Jacob Høigilt's example](/contents/htmls/tidslinje.html). Can be used with this [.csv file](/contents/tidslinje.csv). Tutorial for the [gg_vistime package](https://shosaco.github.io/vistime/articles/gg_vistime-vignette.html).

## Python resources

### Installing and running Python and Anaconda

* How to install Python and Anaconda, create environments and install packages, and execute Python scripts: [Erik Skare's quick guide](/contents/htmls/python.html).

### Text preprocessing

We usually need to preprocess our text before analysis (removing [stopwords](https://kavita-ganesan.com/what-are-stop-words/#.Y9kqAq3MJaQ), [lemmatization](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/lemmatization), and [tokenization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-how-tokenizing-text-sentence-words-works/)). This is what we call Natural Language Processing (NLP). Although R is one of our favourite tools for text mining and analysis, Python has several packages that are superior when doing NLP:

* Norwegian Natural Language Processing with SpaCy: [Erik Skare's example](/contents/htmls/spacy_language_processing.html).
* Arabic Natural Language Processing with Camel Tools: [Thomas Hegghammer's exmaple](https://gist.github.com/Hegghammer/f6b10677a03416642caae6426912eed9).
* Persian Natural Language Processing with Hazm: [Erik Skare's example](/contents/htmls/persian_nlp.html).
* Chinese Natural Language Processing with Jieba: [Erik Skare's example](/contents/htmls/chinese_nlp.html)

## Markdown resources:

* Markdown with Zotero and Better Bibtex: [Jacob Høigilt's example](/contents/htmls/betterbibtex/markdown_zotero.html). 
* Writing markdown in Quarto: [Jacob Høigilt's markdown script](/contents/htmls/miniguide_quarto.html).
* Modifying VS Codium through its settings.json file: [Erik Skare's example](/contents/htmls/optimizing_vs_codium.html).

## A quick guide for High Performance Computing (HPC) and Slurm

High Performance Computing (HPC) is becoming increasingly important as we process, analyze, and perform complex calculations of increasing amounts of data. HPC uses clusters of powerful processors that work in parallel at extremely high speeds. The University of Oslo has its own HPC cluster called [Fox](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/fox/index.html).

* How run Python and R scripts in Fox: [Erik Skare's quick guide](/contents/htmls/quick_guide_to_hpc_and_slurm.html).
