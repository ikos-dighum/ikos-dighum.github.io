Welcome to the home page for the Digital IKOS (DIKOS) seminar series, which is based at  at the Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages (IKOS) at the Faculty of Humanities, University of Oslo. 

  Here you will find the program for each semester and other useful resources. Our aim is to encourage scholars in the humanities to use digital tools in research through themed seminars, hands-on, problem-solving 
workshops, and sharing through our website. We concentrate on learning and applying R to analyze data, create visualizations, and working with text. We also aim to create a hub for resources on how to work programmatically with text in non-Latin languages such as Arabic, Persian, Japanese, and Mandarin.

The DIKOS group meets every second Thursday throughout the semester – see the calendar for details. Besides serving as the home of repositories made by group members, this website functions as a communication hub between meetings.

Feel free to contact Jacob Høigilt (jacobhoi@uio.no) or Erik Skare (eriskar@uio.no) with any questions or suggestions.
